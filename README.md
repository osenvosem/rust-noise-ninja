The application is entirely written in Rust utilizing the Tauri 2 and Leptos frameworks.

## Key Features

-   **Preset Management**: Save and load your customized presets effortlessly.
-   **Scheduling Playback**: Plan your sound playback with precision by setting the exact day, time, and duration or schedule periodic playback on specific days and times.

-   **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Available for MacOS, Windows, Linux, and Android (not thoroughly tested on each platform, though).
