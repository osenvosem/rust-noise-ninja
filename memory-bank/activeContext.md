# Active Context: Rust Noise Ninja

## Current Work Focus

The project is currently in the initial setup phase, with a focus on establishing the core architecture and implementing the main application components. The team is working on building out the visual interface, sound library integration, and basic playback functionality.

## Recent Changes

-   Project structure established with Rust and Tauri framework
-   Basic UI components created (button, control panel, grid, presets, schedule, settings menu, sound library)
-   Core application logic started in src/app.rs and src/main.rs
-   Sound library structure defined with categorized audio files
-   Tauri configuration in place
-   Build system (Cargo, Trunk) configured

## Next Steps

1. Complete the grid interface functionality
2. Implement sound library loading and playback
3. Build the scheduling system
4. Develop preset management
5. Add settings menu functionality
6. Implement cross-platform build configuration
7. Add audio mixing and volume controls
8. Test and optimize performance

## Active Decisions and Considerations

-   Using Tauri framework for cross-platform desktop application
-   Rust as the primary language for performance and safety
-   Grid-based interface for noise pattern creation
-   Categorized sound library approach
-   Real-time playback with visual feedback
-   Audio mixing capabilities for combining multiple sounds

## Important Patterns and Preferences

-   Component-based architecture using Rust modules
-   State management for UI components
-   Asynchronous audio loading and playback
-   Responsive design principles
-   Cross-platform compatibility considerations
-   Performance optimization for real-time audio processing

## Learnings and Project Insights

-   Tauri provides good cross-platform support but requires careful configuration
-   Rust's memory safety is beneficial for audio processing applications
-   Grid-based interfaces work well for pattern creation
-   Audio library organization by category improves usability
-   Real-time feedback is crucial for user experience in audio applications
-   Development environment may have CPU compatibility issues (as seen with Tauri dev command failing)

## Current Status Update

Based on the project progress, we are now moving into the implementation phase where the core functionality needs to be built out. The UI components exist but need full integration with backend logic and audio processing capabilities.

## Updated Next Steps

1. [x] Complete grid interface functionality (in progress)
2. [x] Implement sound library loading and playback (in progress)
3. [ ] Build scheduling system
4. [ ] Develop preset management
5. [ ] Add settings menu functionality
6. [ ] Implement cross-platform build configuration
7. [ ] Add audio mixing and volume controls
8. [ ] Test and optimize performance

## Key Implementation Focus Areas

-   Audio playback engine integration
-   Grid pattern creation and editing capabilities
-   State management for all UI components
-   Cross-platform testing and optimization
-   Performance monitoring and improvement
