# System Patterns: Rust Noise Ninja

## System Architecture

The Rust Noise Ninja application follows a component-based architecture pattern with the following key components:

1. **UI Layer**: Tauri-based desktop interface with Rust frontend components
2. **Application Logic**: Core Rust application logic managing state and functionality
3. **Audio Engine**: Asynchronous audio processing and playback system
4. **Data Management**: State management for patterns, presets, and schedules
5. **Sound Library**: Categorized audio file management system

## Key Technical Decisions

-   **Frontend Framework**: Tauri with Rust backend for cross-platform desktop applications
-   **Audio Processing**: Asynchronous loading and playback to prevent UI blocking
-   **State Management**: Component-based state handling for UI elements
-   **File Structure**: Organized sound library by categories (boom, construction, doors, eerie, people)
-   **Pattern System**: Grid-based pattern creation with visual feedback

## Design Patterns in Use

1. **Component Pattern**: UI components are modular and reusable (button, control panel, grid, etc.)
2. **Observer Pattern**: State changes in one component notify related components
3. **Factory Pattern**: Sound library loading and management system
4. **State Pattern**: Application states (playing, paused, stopped) and UI state transitions
5. **Strategy Pattern**: Different scheduling strategies for pattern playback

## Component Relationships

-   The grid component serves as the primary interface for creating noise patterns
-   The sound library provides audio resources to the grid and other components
-   The control panel manages playback controls and settings
-   Presets system interacts with the grid and scheduling systems
-   Schedule component coordinates timing with the main application logic

## Critical Implementation Paths

1. Grid component initialization and event handling
2. Audio loading and playback integration
3. Sound library categorization and retrieval
4. State management between components
5. Cross-platform build configuration
6. Performance optimization for real-time audio processing

## Data Flow Patterns

-   User interactions flow from UI components to application logic
-   Application logic updates state which triggers UI component refreshes
-   Audio engine receives commands from application logic for playback
-   Sound library provides data to grid and other components on demand
-   Scheduling system coordinates timing with main application loop

## Error Handling Patterns

-   Graceful degradation when audio files are missing or corrupted
-   User-friendly error messages for invalid pattern configurations
-   Automatic recovery from temporary audio system issues
-   Logging of critical errors for debugging and improvement

## Updated System Patterns

Based on current implementation progress, the following patterns have been validated:

-   Component-based architecture is working well for UI organization
-   Asynchronous audio processing prevents UI blocking (validated)
-   State management pattern supports smooth UI transitions (validated)
-   Grid-based interface works effectively for pattern creation (validated)
-   Categorized sound library improves usability (validated)

## Future Considerations

-   Integration of more advanced audio processing techniques
-   Enhanced error recovery mechanisms
-   Performance monitoring and optimization strategies
-   Scalability patterns for larger sound libraries
-   Cross-platform consistency improvements
