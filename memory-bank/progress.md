# Progress: Rust Noise Ninja

## What Works

-   Project structure is established with proper Rust and Tauri organization
-   Basic UI components are created (button, control panel, grid, presets, schedule, settings menu, sound library)
-   Core application logic files exist (src/app.rs, src/main.rs)
-   Sound library structure is defined with categorized audio files
-   Tauri configuration is in place
-   Build system (Cargo, Trunk) is configured
-   Cross-platform framework (Tauri) is selected and implemented

## What's Left to Build

-   Complete implementation of grid interface functionality
-   Sound library loading and playback integration
-   Scheduling system implementation
-   Preset management system
-   Settings menu functionality
-   Audio mixing capabilities
-   Performance optimization for real-time audio processing
-   Cross-platform build testing and configuration
-   Comprehensive testing suite

## Current Status

The project is in the initial development phase. Core infrastructure is in place, but the main application features are not yet fully implemented. The UI components exist but need to be connected to the backend logic.

## Known Issues

-   Audio playback functionality not yet implemented
-   Grid interface lacks full pattern creation capabilities
-   Scheduling and preset systems are not developed
-   Settings menu functionality is incomplete
-   Performance optimization for audio processing needs work

## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   Started with Tauri framework for cross-platform support - decision remains solid
-   Rust chosen for performance and safety - decision remains solid
-   Grid-based interface design - decision remains solid
-   Categorized sound library approach - decision remains solid
-   Component-based architecture - decision remains solid

## Next Milestones

1. Implement core audio playback functionality (Week 1-2)
2. Complete grid pattern creation and editing (Week 2-3)
3. Build scheduling system (Week 3-4)
4. Develop preset management (Week 4-5)
5. Add settings menu functionality (Week 5-6)
6. Performance optimization and testing (Week 6-7)
7. Cross-platform build testing (Week 7-8)
